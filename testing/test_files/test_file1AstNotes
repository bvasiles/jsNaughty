What is the 'definitions' block?
More than just names, but if it has "type": "name"...
geom2d

Under another definitions block:
sum, numeric,

Uniques in order:
geom2d - definitions 1 start, no reference link
sum - definitions 2 start, no reference link
numeric - defintions 2 start, no reference link
numberEquals - definitions 2 start, no reference link (there is a one under 'thedef' that points to the later copy?)
a -> hardcoded under definitions 2 and linked (without any reference to another start tag) from 'thedef', 'orig' which presumably links to its location in definitions? 
Vector2d -> properties -> start (puts this at line 21), another one has a start reference where it is paired with an 'end on line 4' (This seems correct, similarly patterned)
x - only start reference links
y - only start reference links
this -> 4 instances with a hard-coded start.
mix -> hardcoded hard and then reference to it under 'thedef'
dotproduct -> hardcoded somewhere with references later (but not clearly under 'thedef')
vector(1+2) -> two versions, both linked from start under 'thedef' to an orig 
equals -> label and a hardcoded start under properties -> args (b/c its a label ref?)
epsilon -> start link under 'thedef'
dest ->  linked from start under 'thedef' to an orig 
src -> linked from start under 'thedef' to an orig 
k -> linked from start under 'thedef' to an orig

From another way, what are all the 'thedef' tags looking like?
(38 of them...)

Many we need to follow the reference under 'orig' always and not just what we find under a start?
